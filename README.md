# German Traffic Sign Recognition System

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.

In this project, I have performed the following tasks:
1. Downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the downloaded data.
3. Trains Classifier to identify and classify images.
4. Create an Application which can be deployed using [Binder](!https://mybinder.org/)
